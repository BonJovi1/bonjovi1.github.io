### Music
Because without Music, life would B Flat.

Apart from Computer Science, I have a huge fondess for music. Music has been, and always will be, a very important part of my life. It gets me through the best of times and the worst of times. But of course, when I say 'Music', I don't mean the pop and electronic computerized stuff that you hear on the radio today. What I mean is pure music, you know, with genuine instruments. I am especially passionate ‘70s and ‘80s rock n’ roll. I love to play the drums and the acoustic guitar. Some of my favourite bands include Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, U2 and Bon Jovi. Check out my blog if you want to see my thoughts and opinions on some awesome records! 

I have been learning how to drum since I was in the 6th grade. That was the time when Green Day's '21st Century Breakdown' record was all over the rock radio stations. I remember listening to Trè Cool's drums on that and that was when I knew that I wanted to be a drummer!

#### Other than Rock 
Other than classic rock n' roll, I also love some country music, the one with banjos and fiddles! Shania Twain, widely regarded as the Queen of Country Pop, is one of my all time favourite artists. I absolutely love her country music. Apart from Shania, I also listen to Keith Urban, Tim McGraw, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift (her old stuff). I also like to listen to the classic pop boy bands and I'm a huge fan of Take That, arguably the greatest British boy-band of all time. I also like the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC and Westlife. 

During the summer of 2017, I decided to pick up an acoustic guitar for the first time in my life. I didn't just want to listen to music and play covers of famous songs, I wanted to compose too! And I knew that that would be impossible if I didn't learn how to play the guitar. People do a lot of things during their summer breaks and spend their time judiciously. I don't know if playing the guitar 24x7 for three months was worth it, but I finally learnt how to play the instrument decently well. 

### Cinema

I am also a big fan of English cinema, with a  particular fondness for the neo-noir genre. I am one of the very few people who watches a movie not because of the actor or actress, but because of the director! Some of my favourite directors include Quentin Tarantino and David Fincher. 

I am a huge Star Wars fan, and a staunch believer in the Force, the invisible energy field that ‘binds us, surrounds us, and holds this galaxy together’. 

### Philosophy

I am also very interested in Philosophy and I often like to muse about life and death. ‘The study of knowledge’ as it truly is, I love to contemplate on classic philosophical problems such as, ‘who are we’ and ‘is there really any purpose to our lives’ etc. Most of my philosophies are inspired by David Hume, one of the greatest thinkers of the 17th century, and Prof Madhava, whose teachings are famously dubbed as ‘Madhavism’.
