Hi there! I'm a senior year student at the International Institute of Information Technology [(IIIT), Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), pursuing my bachelors in computer science and engineering. I am an undergraduate honors researcher at the [Robotics Research Center (RRC)](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/), lucky to be advised by [Prof. K. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en). I like to work at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning and robotics, with a focus on vision-based robot navigation. 

I am also associated with the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), where I've been fortunate to work on research projects with [Prof. P.J. Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Avinash Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) during my junior and senior years. During the summer of 2020, I interned at [Siemens Corporate Research](https://new.siemens.com/in/en.html) in Bangalore, India, where I worked with the Advanced Data Management research group.

I am really interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I love working in robotic vision. My research is all about extracting crucial information from images and helping robots understand what they see. My other interests include human pose estimation and neuromorphic vision algorithms.  If you'd like to know more about my work or have questions about anything else, feel free to send me an email!
