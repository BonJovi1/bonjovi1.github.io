Hi there! I'm a grad student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), pursuing my Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. I work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CS-3630](https://harishravichandarblog.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/cs3630_fall2021_syllabus-v1-aug_22.pdf): Introduction to Perception and Robotics at the [School of Interactive Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/school-interactive-computing). I love writing code to build user-friendly software and training deep neural networks to accomplish wondrous computer vision tasks!  

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I was extremely lucky to be advised by the amazing [Prof. K. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Robotics Research Center (RRC)](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/). I worked mainly on vision-guided robot navigation tasks and was fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. P.J. Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Avinash Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) during my time there. I also spent a summer at [Siemens Corporate Research](https://new.siemens.com/in/en.html) in Bangalore, India, where I worked with the Advanced Data Management research group.

I wish to use my knowledge of software development and machine learning to build efficient software programs that would create a meaningful impact on people's everyday lives, whilst further pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.

Hi there! I’m a senior year student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad, pursuing my bachelors in computer science and engineering. I am an undergraduate honours researcher at the Robotics Research Center (RRC), lucky to be advised by Prof. K. Madhava Krishna. I like to work at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning and robotics, with a focus on vision-based robot navigation.

I am also associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), where I’ve been fortunate to work on research projects with Prof. P.J. Narayanan and Prof. Avinash Sharma during my junior and senior years. I also spent a summer at Siemens Corporate Research in Bangalore, India, where I worked with the Advanced Data Management research group.

I am really interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I love working in robotic vision. My research is all about extracting crucial information from images and helping robots understand what they see. My other interests include human pose estimation and neuromorphic vision algorithms. If you’d like to know more about my work or have questions about anything else, feel free to send me an email! -->
