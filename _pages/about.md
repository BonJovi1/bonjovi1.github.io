Hi there! I'm a senior year computer science undergraduate at the International Institute of Information Technology [(IIIT), Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I'm an honours research student at the [Robotics Research Center (RRC)](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en), where I like to work at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning and robotics, with a focus on vision-based robot navigation.  

I have been associated with [RRC]((https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/)) for over a year, working on several projects with [Prof. Madhava]((https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en)) that involve a wondrous blend of vision and robotics. Currently, I am working on deep optical flow estimation for unsupervised and scene agnostic image-based visual servoing. Our team aims to propose a novel model predictive visual servoing framework which processes visual features, trains on-the-fly and generates optimal control to successfully servo the environment.

I am also working a research project in human motion synthesis advised by [Prof. Avinash Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en), at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My work involves the 3D capture of high-speed human motions using event cameras.  

#### Research Experience
During the Summer of 2020, I worked at [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/in/en.html) as a computer vision intern in the Research in Digitalisation and Automation business unit. I was associated with the visual perception lab, where I worked heavily in pose estimation and action recognition. 

In Spring 2020, I also worked on a research project in face detection and recognition advised by [Prof. PJ Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My work involved blending machine learning models with computer vision for society related applications. I also worked on a project with [Prof. Avinash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) on 3D semantic scene segmentation. 

In Fall 2018, I worked as a software development intern at the [Virtual Labs](http://www.vlab.co.in/), a social initiative of the government of India. I developed full fledged experiments and interactive artefacts for various data structures and algorithms using software engineering research principles.

#### Research Interests
I am really interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I love working in robotic vision. Without vision, a robot is just blind. We can always move it around, but we'd need to process visual data from the world to make it move intelligently. 

I am deeply passionate about computer vision, with a particular fondness for 3D scene understanding and object recognition. As part of the vision and AI courses at my university, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on some very engaging projects.
