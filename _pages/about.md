Hi there! I'm a junior year computer scientist at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad. I'm an honours research student at the Robotics Research Center (RRC) under [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en), where I like to work at the intersection of computer vision and robotics. 

I am extremely passionate about *computer vision*, with a particular fondness for 3D scene understanding, image segmentation and object recognition. I am really interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I chose to work in robotic vision in the first place! The applications of vision to robotics is something really unique and amazing. Without robotic vision, a robot is just blind. We can always move it around, but we'd need to process visual data from the world to make it move intelligently. 

I am currently working on deep optical flow estimation for unsupervised and sequence guided scene agnostic visual servoing. Our team at RRC aims to propose a novel pipeline that processes visual features like depth and flow and generates control to successfully servo the environment.

Iâ€™m also working on an independent project in face detection and recognition under [Prof. PJ Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT). My work involves blending machine learning models with computer vision for society related applications.

In Fall 2018, I worked as a software research intern at The Virtual Labs, a social initiative of the government of India, under [Prof. Venkatesh Choppella](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~venkatesh.choppella/). I developed full fledged experiments and interactive artefacts for various data structures and algorithms using software engineering research principles. 

For Summer 2020, I will be working at Siemens Technology, Bangalore as a computer vision intern in the digitalisation and automation research division. I look forward to learn more and apply my existing knowledge of ML and vision on some interesting projects!
