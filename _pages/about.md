Hi there! I'm a junior year computer science undergraduate at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad. I'm an honours research student at the Robotics Research Center (RRC) under [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en), where I like to work at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning and robotics. 

I'm currently working at Siemens as a computer vision intern in the Research in Digitalisation and Automation business unit. My work revolves around pose estimation, gait analysis and face recognition. 

At RRC, I am working on deep optical flow estimation for unsupervised, sequence guided and scene agnostic visual servoing. Our team aims to propose a novel pipeline that processes visual features like depth and  flow and generates control using an LSTM based approach to successfully servo the environment.

I’m also working on a research project in face detection and recognition advised by [Prof. PJ Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT). My work involves blending machine learning models with computer vision for society related applications.

I am extremely passionate about computer vision, with a particular fondness for 3D scene understanding, pose estimation and object recognition. I am really interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I chose to work in robotic vision in the first place! Without robotic vision, a robot is just blind. We can always move it around, but we'd need to process visual data from the world to make it move intelligently. 

In Fall 2018, I worked as a software developer intern at The Virtual Labs, a social initiative of the government of India. I developed full fledged experiments and interactive artefacts for various data structures and algorithms using software engineering research principles. 

As part of the vision, ML and AI courses at my university, I’ve had the opportunity to work on some very fascinating projects. Do check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bonjovi1) for some interesting ones!
