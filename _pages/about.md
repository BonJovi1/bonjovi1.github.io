Hi there! I'm a senior year computer science undergraduate at the International Institute of Information Technology [(IIIT), Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I'm an honours research student at the [Robotics Research Center (RRC)](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en), where I like to work at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning and robotics, with a focus on vision-based robot navigation.  

Currently, I am working on a learning-based model predictive framework for unsupervised image-based visual servoing. I am also working a research project in human motion synthesis advised by [Prof. Avinash Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en), at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My work involves the 3D capture of high-speed human motions using event cameras. Previously, during the summer of 2020, I worked at [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/in/en.html) as a computer vision intern at the visual perception lab. 

I am really interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I love working in robotic vision. Without vision, a robot is just blind. We can always move it around, but we'd need to process visual data from the world to make it move intelligently. My research is all about extracting crucial information from images and helping computers understand what they see.
