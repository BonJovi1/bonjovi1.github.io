Hi there! I'm a junior year computer scientist at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad. I'm an honours research student at the Robotics Research Center (RRC) under [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en), where I like to work at the intersection of computer vision and robotics. 

I am currently working on deep optical flow estimation for unsupervised, sequence guided and scene agnostic visual servoing. Our team at RRC aims to propose a novel pipeline that processes visual features like depth and optical flow and generates control using an LSTM based approach to successfully servo the environment.

I’m also working on an independent project in face detection and recognition under [Prof. PJ Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT). My work involves blending machine learning models with computer vision for society related applications.

I am extremely passionate about **computer vision**, with a particular fondness for 3D scene understanding, image segmentation and object recognition. I am really interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I chose to work in robotic vision in the first place! Without robotic vision, a robot is just blind. We can always move it around, but we'd need to process visual data from the world to make it move intelligently. 

In Fall 2018, I worked as a software research intern at The Virtual Labs, a social initiative of the government of India, under [Prof. Venkatesh Choppella](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~venkatesh.choppella/). I developed full fledged experiments and interactive artefacts for various data structures and algorithms using software engineering research principles. 

For Summer 2020, I will be working at Siemens Technology, Bangalore as a computer vision intern in the digitalisation and automation research division. 

As part of the vision, ML and AI courses at my university, I’ve had the opportunity to work on some very fascinating projects. Do check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bonjovi1) for some interesting ones!
