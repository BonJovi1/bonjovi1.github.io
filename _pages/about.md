Hi there! I'm a senior year undergraduate at the International Institute of Information Technology [(IIIT), Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), pursuing my bachelors in computer science. I am an honours researcher at the [Robotics Research Center (RRC)](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en), where I like to work at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning and robotics, with a focus on vision-based robot navigation.  

I have also had the opportunity to work on projects with [Prof. PJ Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Avinash Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). During the summer of 2020, I interned at [Siemens Corporate Research](https://new.siemens.com/in/en.html) in Bangalore, India, at the visual perception lab. Do check out the [research](https://bonjovi1.github.io/research/) tab to know more about my work. 

I am really interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I love working in robotic vision. Without vision, a robot is just blind. We can always move it around, but we'd need to process visual data from the world to make it move intelligently. My research is all about extracting crucial information from images and helping computers understand what they see.
