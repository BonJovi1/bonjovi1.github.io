Hi there! I'm a junior year computer science student at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad. I'm an honours research student at the Robotics Research Center (RRC) under Prof. Madhava Krishna, where I like to work at the intersection of computer vision and robotics. I am currently working on deep optical flow estimation for unsupervised visual servoing. I am also interested in the interplay between vision and other fields, which is why I chose to work in robotic vision in the first place! 

I am also associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), where Iâ€™m working on an independent project in 3D scene reconstruction under Prof. PJ Narayanan. I am extremely passionate about computer vision, with a particular fondness for 3D scene understanding and image segmentation.
