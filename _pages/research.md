### Current Work

I have been associated with [RRC]((https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/)) for over a year, working on several projects with [Prof. Madhava](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en) that involve a wondrous blend of vision and robotics. Currently, I am working on deep optical flow estimation for unsupervised and scene agnostic image-based visual servoing. Our team aims to propose a novel model predictive visual servoing framework which processes visual features, trains on-the-fly and generates optimal control to successfully servo the environment. I've had the opportunity to work with some incredible people at RRC, such as [Dr. Harit Pandya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bOWP5gQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Gourav Kumar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=zyYNatcAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Currently, I'm also working with [Prof. Avinash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) in the generation of asynchronous event trajectories and capturing high-speed motions from event cameras.

### Past Experience

During the Summer of 2020, I worked at [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/in/en.html) in the corporate research division. I was associated with the visual perception lab, where I worked heavily in pose estimation and its extension to action recognition. 

I am deeply passionate about computer vision, with a particular fondness for 3D scene understanding and object recognition. In Spring 2020, I worked on a research project in face detection and recognition advised by [Prof. PJ Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My work involved blending machine learning models with computer vision for society related applications. I also worked on a project with [Prof. Avinash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) in 3D semantic scene segmentation, which involved combining 2D feature maps with 3D voxel data. 

In Fall 2018, I worked as a research intern at the [Virtual Labs](http://www.vlab.co.in/), a social initiative of the government of India. I developed full fledged experiments and interactive artefacts for various data structures and algorithms using software engineering research principles.

As part of the vision and AI courses at my university, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on some very engaging projects. Do check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bonjovi1) for some interesting ones!
