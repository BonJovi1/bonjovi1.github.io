I have been associated with the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) for almost two years now, working on projects with [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en) that involve a wondrous blend of vision and robotics. Most recently, our work titled 'Deep Model Predictive Control for Visual Servoing' was accepted at the [Conference on Robot Learning, 2020](https://www.robot-learning.org/home)! We proposed a novel image-based visual servoing framework which processes visual features, trains on-the-fly and generates optimal control to successfully servo the environment. 

I've had the opportunity to work with some incredible people at RRC, such as [Dr. Harit Pandya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bOWP5gQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Gourav Kumar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=zyYNatcAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I am also working with [Prof. Avinash Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) in human motion synthesis. We are working on the generation of asynchronous event trajectories using photometric feature tracking in order to capture high-speed motions from event cameras.

### Past Experience

During the Summer of 2020, I worked at [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/in/en.html) in the corporate research division. I was associated with the visual perception lab, where I worked heavily in pose estimation and its extension to action recognition. 

In Spring 2020, I worked on a research project in face detection advised by [Prof. PJ Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My work involved blending machine learning models with computer vision for society related applications. I also worked on a project with [Prof. Avinash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4ladtC0AAAAJ&hl=en) in 3D semantic scene segmentation, which involved combining 2D feature maps with 3D voxel data. 

In Fall 2018, I worked as a research intern at the [Virtual Labs](http://www.vlab.co.in/), a social initiative of the government of India. I worked with my friend [Gaurav Batra](https://gauravbatra.netlify.app/) and developed full fledged experiments and interactive artefacts for various data structures and algorithms using software engineering research principles.

I am deeply passionate about computer vision, with a particular fondness for 3D scene understanding and object recognition. As part of the vision and AI courses at my university, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on some very engaging projects.
