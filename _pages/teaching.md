There is nothing that stregthens one's conceptual understanding more than teaching it to someone. I have always loved to teach and I've had the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant for a couple of courses at IIIT, Hyderabad. 

### Digital Logic and Processors
#### Monsoon 2019

This one has always been my favourite course at IIIT, as it is the most fundamental course in computer science. People can learn to code and build mobile applications and become a 'software developer'. But to truly be a comouter ENGINEER, it is essential to have a fundamental understanding of the design and architecture of a computer and how it's built from the inside. 

Digital Logic and Processors is a foundational computer systems course offered at IIIT, Hyderabad. I was responsible for creating assignments and teaching the fundamentals of digital logic and the architecture a simple 8-bit processor, under [Prof. Aftab Hussain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDfsQv0AAAAJ&hl=en). The latter was the most awesome part! I believe that as computer scientists, one must know how to build a simple processor from scratch! 

### Design and Analysis of Software Systems
#### Spring 2020

The most famous software engineering course offered at IIIT, Hyderabad, where one learns good web development and building web and mobile applications. But the course isn't just famous for its amazing assignments, but also for its project component. Students form teams and actually have to work for real life client for their project. The clients usually include the thousands of start-ups in and around Hyderabad. Students work for these clients for 4 months, giving them some valuable industry experience and exposure. 

I had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for this course under [Prof. Ramesh Loganthan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rameshl/?originalSubdomain=in). I was responsible for setting and evaluating assignments and teaching how to build web applications, coding well in Python and JavaScript and a bunch of software engineering principles.
