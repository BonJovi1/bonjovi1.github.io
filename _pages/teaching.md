There is nothing that stregthens one's conceptual understanding more than teaching it to someone. I have always loved to teach and I've had the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant for a couple of courses at IIIT, Hyderabad. 

### Digital Logic and Processors
#### Monsoon 2019

Digital Logic and Processors is a foundational computer systems course offered at IIIT, Hyderabad. I was responsible for creating assignments and teaching the fundamentals of digital logic and the architecture a simple 8-bit processor, under [Prof. Aftab Hussain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDfsQv0AAAAJ&hl=en). The latter was the most awesome part! I believe that as computer scientists, one must know how to build a simple processor from scratch! 

This one has always been my favourite course at IIIT, as it is the most fundamental course in computer science. People can learn to code and build mobile applications and become a 'software developer'. But to truly be a comouter ENGINEER, it is essential to have a fundamental understanding of the design and architecture of a computer and how it's built from the inside. 

### Design and Analysis of Software Systems
#### Spring 2020

I had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for this course under [Prof. Ramesh Loganathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rameshl/?originalSubdomain=in). I was responsible for setting and evaluating assignments and teaching how to build web applications, coding well in Python and JavaScript and a bunch of software engineering principles.   

This is the most famous software engineering course offered at IIIT, Hyderabad, where one learns good web development skills and the art of building web and mobile applications. But the course isn't just famous for its amazing assignments, but also for its project component. Students form teams and have to work for real life clients as part of their projects. The clients usually include the thousands of start-ups in and around Hyderabad. Students work for these clients for 4 months, earning some valuable industry experience and exposure.
